## Why can I only glow in one color (usually white)? 

Possible reasons include:

- Make sure placeholders are set properly. See [installation guide](../installation) for more info.
- Outdated FancyGlow or outdated dependencies.
- Shaders may not render the correct glowcolor (if the shader even support the glow feature at all).
